With the created tables, we used tableau tool to develop visual content to help us uncover the rationality of bike riders. 

With our first visual we uncovered the following:

### Stations per member and casual users
Our first visual crossed the stations of the bike service per type of member.

As the dashboard shows, the stations with greater 'casual' users are those located closest to Points of Interest, such as the national mall, white house, tidal basin and 14th St. This is a predictive behavior as tourists would be less likely to be interested in obtaining a membership of a service that, once they fly back home, will not use again.

Secondly, the dasbhboard shows that stations with greater 'member' type of users are found closest to the corporate hubs, such as Union Station, Dupont Circle, Massachussets avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Logan Circle.

An additional aspect that we noticed is that stations that show a greater commute advantage showed higher numbers of 'member' riders. 
This prediction was shown accurate when looking at the station located in 15th St & P. The station is located in a convenient city route which (1) counts with a dedicated bike lane and (2) connects conveniently Columbia Heights with dowtown (H Street) therefore being a strategic commute route.


### Number of trips by registered and casual riders
When crossing the number of trips done by both registered and casual riders we got the following visual:

As it can be seen, indeed the mayority of bike trips have been taken by member riders (registered) than by casual ones. This observation is a very predictive pattern considering that by thinking of 'membership' already speaks of a very loyal and frequent user audience.

Also, the 'member' type ratio increased steadily until 2019. This is also a predictive behaviour considering that year 2020, in the early months, was struck by the covid 19 pandemic.

Lastly, this visual also shows a predictive behaviour that is a low number of bike rides during the 1st and 4th Quarters of the year. These timeframe corresponds to the winter months.



### Pre-Covid and Post-Covid Bike Users Trend
The third visuals compared the change in both bike ride trends and the ratio of member usage between Pre-Covid and Post-Covid:

These visuals also confirmed the rationality of riders' choice by showing that 'member' users use up to 80-85% more the service during the week than on the weekend, which falls to a 64-65%.

This is also a predictive behavior as, if 'member' type riders use the service more for commute and transportation to work, the weekends will certainly show a downfall in usage as those are not working days.

A takeway from this visual is that eventhough on weekends, the bike service is still the prefered means of transportation, even for those with a permanent residency in the city.

Because of time constraint we were no longer able to dive deeper into this visual however, the team suggests the following analysis in future:
