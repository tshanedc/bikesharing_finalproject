With the created tables, we used tableau tool to develop visual content to help us uncover the rationality of bike riders. 

With our first visual we uncovered the following:

### Stations per member and casual users
Our first visual crossed the stations of the bike service per type of member.

As the dashboard shows, the stations with greater 'casual' users are those located closest to Points of Interest, such as the national mall, white house, tidal basin and 14th St. This is a predictive behavior as tourists would be less likely to be interested in obtaining a membership of a service that, once they fly back home, will not use again.

Secondly, the dasbhboard shows that stations with greater 'member' type of users are found closest to the corporate hubs, such as Union Station, Dupont Circle, Massachussets avenue, Rhode Island Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Logan Circle.

An additional aspect that we noticed is that stations that show a greater commute advantage showed higher numbers of 'member' riders. 
This prediction was shown accurate when looking at the station located in 15th St & P. The station is located in a convenient city route which (1) counts with a dedicated bike lane and (2) connects conveniently Columbia Heights with dowtown (H Street) therefore being a strategic commute route.


### Number of trips by registered and casual riders
When crossing the number of trips done by both registered and casual riders we got the following visual:

As it can be seen, indeed the mayority of bike trips have been taken by member riders (registered) than by casual ones. This observation is a very predictive pattern considering that by thinking of 'membership' already speaks of a very loyal and frequent user audience.

In a glance, the 'member' type ratio increased steadily until 2019. However, the ratio between member and casual drastically reverses in 2020 due to the covid 19 pandemic. We will reassess this impact in the map again to identify the most current behavior of users.

### Pre-Covid and Post-Covid Bike Users Trend
The third visuals compared the change in both bike ride trends and the ratio of member usage between Pre-Covid and Post-Covid:

These visuals shows that not only overall volume of bike ride reduced around corporate hubs by change in the data point size, the overall ratio of 'member' usage converted to 'casual' as the color shifted to blue from red.

This is also a predictive behavior as, if 'member' type riders use the service more for commute and transportation to work, we would see less riding by those users when Covid was focing many to work remotely (or overall workforce was declined).

Also, when commuting is not consistent, those 'member' users could have turn themselves into 'casual' users based on less frequent need of riding a bike. 

There are three takeaways from these visuals:

1. The 'member type' of bike users are largely depended on the location of bike stations and whether Weekday or Weekend that they are riding. Thus we can identify that purpose of their bike ride is either for commuting or sightseeing.
2. However, such trend was impacted by Covid that overall trip ride and 'member' usage were declined due to nnecessity of consistent commuting. Rather, we see increase in 'casual' rider in 2020 for both corporate hubs and point of interest.
3. Based on the above points, PBS must reasses the popular bike stations to focus their resource and adjust their membership plan price to re-convert the 'casual' riders back to 'member' riders.
