- Analysis Questions:
What is the growth trend in a specific range of years?
Who are the main users of PBO?
What are the important factors that cause high demand of PBS in certain city/area/time/period?
Are there any factors that cause negative impact on the growthof PBS in the city?(weather, location of bick docks etc)

### Communication Protocol
The protocol is still in progress. However, we will rely our communication on two components (1) follow up meetings and (2) work distribution.

Role Definition
The team has found a natural work dynamic. We will be taking advantage of the already used channels, such as slack and zoom website.

### Machine Learning Model 
Provisional Model
Run a series of regression on correlation between the factors such as weather, seasonality, characteristics of area (office, leisure, academic, etcâ€¦) with the usage of PBS.
Visualize the maps of each city and  show popular routes. Combine the map image with layering and pop-up highlighting the major stations, landmarks to assess the main incentives of riders choosing that routes.
