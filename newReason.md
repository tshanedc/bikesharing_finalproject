### Reasons for Topic Selection

Intially, we were interested in exploring the bike sharing program for its obvious social and environmental benefits such as less traffic congestion, lower CO2 emmission, improving resident mobility and accessibility, bettering resident health outcomes, and reducing commute delays for users of the local transportation system. However, we quickly realized the first hurdle to growing the bike sharing programs was financial investment from private investors in partnership with local and federal government agencies. We pivoted to offering a deeper analysis to investors and the local government agencies to undersand the growing membership trends of public bike sharing rider behavior in Washington DC as a way to encourage further investments and suggesting ways to capitalize on the financial benefits of the growing rider market.

Advantages of investing in bike sharing programs follow a three-pronged economic model:

#### 1. Data Mining
- use the interest on the reveue collected to invest
- member data has high commercial value to retail businesses, restaurants, car sales
- member data has high value to local governments for urban planning and management
- sell users' riding behavior data captured by app and GPS complement datasets collected by taxi and public transportation systems

#### 2. Advertising
- advertising revenue from ads on physical bike, the app used to locate and unlock the bike

#### 3. Profitability
- Interest earned on Membership deposits is substantial income generating asset to invest
- Huge deposit pool each day from Casual riders


We also pivoted away from pursuing and tracking data sources for income, gender, age, and race to focus on the rider and location trends that are already found in the Capital BikeShare data which were central to our hypothesis that understanding the current rider makeup and behavior was a more than sufficient means to suggest recommendations for where growth opportunities existed in Washington, DC. We also discovered that the exploration of how the riders behaved during the COVID19 shutdown would provide beneficial information to investors for how to prepare for future downturns by being able to quickly adjust their marketing and inventory strategies to mitigate losses and perhaps even grow during a downturn.

Our analysis revealed that

### Analysis Question
As previously introduced, our analysis question is **“Are Capital Bike Share riders rational actors?”**.

To sustain, or refute, our hypothesis the analysis dived into:
- Total bike rides per year
- Distribution of ‘member type’ per station
- Time of the day and day of the week of the ride
- Location of Bike stations (lat, long)
