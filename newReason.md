### Reasons for Topic Selection

Intially, we were interested in exploring the bike sharing program for its obvious social and environmental benefits such as less traffic congestion, lower CO2 emmission, improving resident mobility and accessibility, bettering resident health outcomes, and reducing commute delays for users of the local transportation system to expand system. However, we quickly realized the first hurdle to growing the bike sharing programs was financial investment from private investors in partnership with local and federal government agencies. We pivoted to offering a deeper analysis to investors and the local government agencies to undersand the growing membership trends of public bike sharing rider behavior in Washington DC as a way to encourage further investments and suggesting ways to capitalize on the financial benefits of the growing rider market.

Advantages of investing in bike sharing programs follow a three-pronged economic model:

#### 1. Data Mining
- use the interest on the reveue collected to invest
- member data has high commercial value to retail businesses, restaurants, car sales
- member data has high value to local governments for urban planning and management
- sell users' riding behavior data captured by app and GPS complement datasets collected by taxi and public transportation systems

#### 2. Advertising
- advertising revenue from ads on physical bike, the app used to locate and unlock the bike

#### 3. Profitability
- Interest earned on Membership deposits is a substantial income generating asset with which to invest
- Huge deposit pool each day from Casual riders


We also pivoted away from pursuing and tracking data sources for income, gender, age, and race to focus on the rider and location trends that are already found in the Capital BikeShare data which were central to our hypothesis that understanding the current rider makeup and behavior was a more than sufficient means to suggest recommendations for where growth opportunities existed in Washington, DC. We also discovered that the exploration of how the riders behaved during the COVID19 shutdown would provide beneficial information to investors for how to prepare for future downturns by being able to quickly adjust their marketing and inventory strategies to mitigate losses and perhaps even grow during a downturn.

### Analysis Question
Our analysis questions are:

 - Are there rider behaviors we can observe from the ride iniatiation location? 

 - Does weekday or weekend have any effect on riders behavior and their decision to become a member?

 - How have above behaviors changed rates of membership and ridership due to COVID19?

The machine learning - growth of casual riders and member riders changed after COVID19 shutdown

To sustain or refute our hypothesis, the analysis dived into:
- Total bike rides per year
- Distribution of ‘member type’ per station
- 'Time of the day' and 'day of the week' of the ride
- Location of Bike stations (lat, long)


********************************   REVISE ECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS   *************************************

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS
Exploring and visualizing the data confirmed our hypothesis *** that overall bike usage will continue to grow and that there are many ways to incentivize casual riders to convert to become a bike sharing member  ***. 


****Plenty of hypothesis and assumptions were established for the riders and the service. However all those ideas that we thought to be rational (or were thought to have a corelation) turned out to be flawed after the analysis.****


The analysis confirms that member riders initiate trips more during weekdays than weekends, casual members explore more the 'point of interest' areas than the member riders. Riders, in general, ride less during winter than summer. 

A hypothesis that corelating annual growth of memberships by station could potentially predict future stations based on location features such as nearby shopping, schools, restaurants and entertainment availability was difficult to investigate for lack of time, but could prove significant in the future.


The predictability seen in the data makes it easier for the bike sharing service investors and stakeholders to make solid decisions to maintain and grow the current market. 

Considering a pandemic scenario, the evidence seen in the analyis of rider behavior during COVID19, suggests an opportunity area for the service maximization could be:

- Explore the establishment of a contingency plan where some resources can be saved, for example:
- Explore the adjustment of membership costs in order to expand enrollment,
- Explore the reduction of bike stations to ensure that: (1) there is more bike availability in those most used at the moment, (2) the less used bike stations are temporarily suspended to decrease maintenance costs.
