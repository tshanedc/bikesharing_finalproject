Intially, we were interested in exploring the bike sharing program for its obvious social and environmental benefits such as less traffic congestion, lower CO2 emmission, better health outcomes and reducing wait times for local transportation delays. However, we quickly realized the first hurdle to growing the bike sharing programs was financial investment from private investors. We pivoted to to offering a deeper analysis to investors and the local government agencies of the growing membership trends of Public Bike Sharing Services in Washington DC as a way to encourage further investments by highlighting ways to capitalize on the financial benefits of the growing rider market.

Advantages of investing in bike sharing programs follow a three-pronged economic model:
1. Data Mining
- use the interest on the reveue collected to invest
- member data has high commercial value to retail businesses, restaurants, car sales
- member data has high value to local governments for urban planning and management
- sell users' riding behavior data captured by app and GPS complement datasets collected by taxi and public transportation systems
2. Advertising
- advertising revenue from ads on physical bike, the app used to locate and unlock the bike

3. Profitability
- Interest earned on Membership deposits is substantial income generating asset to invest
- Huge deposit pool each day from Casual riders
